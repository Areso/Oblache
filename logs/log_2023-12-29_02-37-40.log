Response text: Hello. This pet-project (later Project) works AS IS, no warranty at all.
Using Project, you agree to that.
You MUST create backups of your databases for sake reasons.
Because I do run project on my own pocket money, 
I limit total size of the databases per 1 user as 100 MBs.
Any account don't used more than 6 monts is subject for deletion with all databases.
